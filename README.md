# Motivation

## About

A combination of trading card games like "Magic: The Gathering" with "Minecraft" items + design and chess's play style that encourages logical and strategic thinking.

## Inspiration

_Basically my scuffed version of Chest-icuffs from the Tommyinnit video with Wilbur, Charlie, and Phil_

# Research
_I'm mostly basing it off of videos and rules I've found from other people who've tried to make the game on Reddit and YouTube_

As previously stated this is a very scuffed version to everything above has been mashed together to suit my tastes and make the game _"work"_. The research was as thourough as it could
be but the execution is on trial for assault and battery of the first-degree.

# Fork and Contribute Knowledge 

If you are looking to fork and add your own things, understand that I have made my own assets for the cards and I'm going to be making the gui on the most convuluted way possible. So go
into this understanding you are most likely going to me using the console/Terminal version with no actual UI.

And as a sidenote, the Json-Java parser I'm using is the sketchiest thing ever but it works god-damnint, so if you want to add or test things use  version **20231013** if you can. if this 
version is no longer availible to be used by people let me know and I will either update my version, find a new parser, or cry. _most likly some combination of the three_
